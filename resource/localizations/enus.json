        "Welcome to the Van der Waals Forces tutorial! Today you'll see one of the most important weak forces in nature, and why atoms behave the way they do.",
        "Here we have two neutral Argon atoms. No electric charge at all. So... why do you think they're slowly moving toward each other? Let's run the simulation and watch closely.",
        "Look at that, they're being pulled together... but then, when they get very close, they suddenly push apart! That attraction followed by strong repulsion is exactly what we call the **Van der Waals force**.",
        "How can two neutral atoms attract? Even though the atoms have no net charge, their electrons are constantly moving. At any moment, one side can become slightly more negative - creating a temporary **induced dipole**. The other atom responds by shifting its electrons too... and the opposite charges attract each other. That weak attraction is the **Van der Waals attraction**.",
        "Now Let's add more.. for fun and science!",
        "There's a perfect distance where attraction and repulsion exactly balance, that's called the **equilibrium distance** (about 3.8 Å for Argon). Here the net force is almost zero, and the atoms settle comfortably. This is why molecules have a natural “size” and don't collapse into each other.",
        "When the electron clouds overlap too much, the **Pauli exclusion principle** kicks in: no two electrons can occupy the same space with the same quantum state. The energy cost becomes enormous - so the atoms push back very hard!",
        "That push-back is why nothing ever truly 'touches' in the classical world, it's all forces! Van der Waals forces are weak on their own, but they're everywhere: they hold liquids together, allow geckos to climb smooth walls, create surface tension, and even make your phone screen feel smooth.",
        "Now, to demonstrate how weak is this force, we'll increase the temperature, first know that the simulation is running at 500 fs/s, and at 0.01 Kelvin, really cold!",
        "Now that we've increased the temperature, the force is not enough to hold the particles together, solid argon quickly became a gas.. and now at 5 fs/s",
        "And Freeze Again!",
        "That's the Van der Waals force in action. You just witnessed one of the fundamental reasons everyday matter behaves the way it does. Great job!"

        "See that? They rush toward each other very quickly! Opposite charges attract with a strong force.\nThis force gets much stronger as the distance decreases, it follows the inverse-square law: double the distance, force drops to one-fourth.",
        "Now let's try two ions with the same charge: two sodium ions (Na⁺ and Na⁺).\nWatch... they push each other away violently! Like charges repel.",
