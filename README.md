# GENESIS Molecular Dynamics Simulator (v0.1)

An interactive real-time molecular dynamics simulator built from scratch.  
Explore atomic forces, phase transitions, molecular shapes and more.

https://github.com/TheBackstageDev/Genesis

## What you can do right now (v0.1)

- Setup your own scenarios using the Compounds selector.
- Watch **phase transitions** — gas → liquid droplets → solid crystals
- See Educative scenarios to teach you about the forces,
- Pause, add compounds, record simulations and save them.

## How to run

**Windows**
1. Download the latest release from itch.io: https://thebackstagedevreal.itch.io/genesis-engine or from the release tab in github
2. Run the installer  
3. Launch the program from Start Menu or Desktop

**Other platforms**  
Building from source is possible but not documented yet.

## Controls (quick reference)

- **WASD** -> move camera  
- **Right mouse drag** -> look around / orbit  
- **SPACE** -> pause / resume simulation  
- **Q** or **+ button** -> open compound selector  
- **Arrows** -> speed up / slow down time  

Full controls tutorial available in-game.

## Current status (v0.1)

This is a **very early version** with lots of missing features, rough edges and bugs are expected.  
But the core simulation, visuals, and tutorials already work and are fun to play with.

Planned for future versions:
- Reactions & chemical changes
- More molecules & complex structures
- Better performance & larger simulations
- Web version

## Feedback & contributions

I’d love to hear what you think!  
- Bugs? Weird behavior? -> open an issue  
- Ideas? Feature requests? -> comment or open a discussion  
- Want to help? → PRs welcome (especially bug fixes, new molecules, UI polish)
